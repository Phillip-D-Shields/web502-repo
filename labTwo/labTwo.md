## PART A

> ### ONE : MEDIA MANAGEMENT

Media management is controlled via the admin dashboard. A section link can be found on the left hand navigation bar. There are also additional menus available on the left hand side for some media related plugins that may be installed.

> ### TWO : ADDING MEDIA

Media managment is straight forward and simple. Files maybe be selected via a file explorer window or by dragging and dropping directly on the designated uplaod area. For the example, I have uploaded four medium sized images and a single video with audio. The entire upload took a few seconds.

I added the video previously uploaded to the contact page, it can be seen below.

> ### THREE : GALLERY IMPLEMENTATION

I have used a media plugin called [FooGallery](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery/?utm_source=wp_plugin&utm_medium=foogallery_free&utm_campaign=help) to create a media gallery for my site. The implementation was simple and easy thanks to the GUI and excellent documentation.

There were some issues creating a custom gallery without having a paid version of FooGallery, so demo galleries will be used. The following steps were followed to add a gallery to one of the pages of my website:

> 1. navigate to the page via the pages link on the left hand nav bar.
> 2. toggle blue block insert menu (upper left hand corner) to open available blocks
> 3. select FooGallery from the MEDIA section
> 4. follow FooGallery block GUI and insert gallery, edit and preview as necessary

## PART B

> ### ONE : PLUGIN MANAGEMENT

Plugin management is pretty straightforward for wordpress using the plugins menu provided in the wordpress graphical user interface. It is easy to search by categories or keywords, choose a specific plugin, read information and user reviiews, and also to add the plugin to your selection of plugins.

> ### TWO : CONTACT FORM

For the contact form I selected the 'wpforms' plugin. I selected this plugin specifically for two main reasons, it has the highest number of users and the best rating out of the most popular contact form plugins. Implementing the plugin is straightforward and simple, especially when utilising on the many templates provided.

> ### THREE : PAYMENTS

For the payments plugin I selected 'stripe for woocommerce'. The main reason for selecting this plugin was the consistently high user rating. There were a couple of plugins with a larger number of user installations, but most had a lower user rating. One of the most noteable features of this plugin is the automated integration with some of the most common forms of payment, including google and apple pay. 
 
> ### FOUR : SOCIAL MEDIA

For the social media plugin, I thought it better to focus on the websites SEO, so I installed the 'Yoast SEO' plugin to maximise my websites hits from search engine activity. I am not interested in most social media, as it is not an important avenue of outreach for most crypto users. The only exception to this is twitter, so a future addition of a twitter plugin is still under consideration.
